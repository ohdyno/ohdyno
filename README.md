### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Xing Zhou (he/him).

I'm an software engineer enthusiastic about:
- ðŸ”„ hyper-iterative software development
- ðŸ’» software application design
- ðŸ«¶ the humans involved in software product development

My repositories are usually focused on teaching (to myself and/or others) concepts applicable to my day-to-day work, though some could be much more tangential. Feel free to use them as you see fit.
