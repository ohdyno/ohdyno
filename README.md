### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Xing Zhou (he/him).

I'm an software engineer enthusiastic about:
- ðŸ”„ hyper-iterative software development
- ðŸ’» software application design
- ðŸ«¶ the humans involved in software product development

My repositories are usually focused on teaching (to myself and/or others) concepts applicable to my day-to-day work, though some could be much more tangential. Feel free to use them as you see fit.

#### Currently Learning
- how to identify activities that I absolutely love and incorporating more of it every day [resource](https://loveandwork.org/)
- how to develop deeper and more compassionate connection with people [resource](https://www.cnvc.org/)
- how to apply and teach refactoring techniques in realtime on real codebases [resource](https://refactoring.com/)
- how to introduce more functional/LISP-y patterns into cloud-native software applications [resource](https://clojure.org/)
